# Welcome

### If you find yourself here, this means that you want to find what all the packages are on the testing environment from EPITECH called MARVIN.  

### The dependencies you find here comes from the docker image epitechcontent/epitest-docker:latest.  

### Disclaimer: These might be different from the actual MARVIN but should be close enough.  

### You now know what to download on your machine to be best prepared for your delivery.  

### Still double check by running the docker yourself as you may have system packages making it work that doesn't for MARVIN.  

### Good luck out there and you're now sure of what to use to not blow your project (I've had my fair share of issue through the incident)

### Last disclaimer: This is only for educational purpose, any malicious use of this such as redistribution is neither in my control nor my responsibility and can lead you to legal trouble.  
### All tools used are open-source and as such are authorized to be used as this is not hacking, just reading the layers of the image (what docker or similar tool does when you run an OCI container)

P.S.: don't bother asking what is the incident.
